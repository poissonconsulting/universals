Description: Provides S3 generic methods and some default implementations
    for Bayesian analyses that generate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples.
    The purpose of 'universals' is to reduce package dependencies and conflicts.
    The 'nlist' package implements many of the methods for its 'nlist' class.
